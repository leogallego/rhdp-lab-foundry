# Validate Lab - Comprehensive Lab Validation with Health Reporting

Validates a lab across multiple dimensions and generates provisioning health check scripts that report results via webhook.

## Validation Stages

Each stage can be skipped via `.foundry-skip` or `--skip` argument.

### Stage 1: structure
Verify the lab has all required files for its type.

**Zero-touch requirements:**
- [ ] config/instances.yaml exists and is valid YAML
- [ ] config/firewall.yaml exists
- [ ] config/networks.yaml exists
- [ ] setup-automation/main.yml exists
- [ ] At least one setup-*.sh script exists
- [ ] runtime-automation/main.yml exists
- [ ] content/antora.yml exists
- [ ] content/modules/ROOT/nav.adoc exists
- [ ] At least one page in content/modules/ROOT/pages/
- [ ] ui-config.yml exists
- [ ] site.yml exists

**AgnosticV requirements:**
- [ ] common.yaml exists and has env_type, cloud_provider
- [ ] common.yaml: git_config_directory URL is reachable (fetch test)
- [ ] common.yaml: referenced content repo's config/instances.yaml parses correctly
- [ ] common.yaml: #include directives reference existing files
- [ ] common.yaml: __meta__.components reference valid catalog items
- [ ] dev.yaml exists
- [ ] description.adoc exists
- [ ] If using base-component: verify base-component version hasn't introduced breaking changes

This is critical because the RHDP team sometimes pushes changes to shared components
(like base-component or includes/) without lab developer review, breaking downstream labs.
The validate stage catches this by verifying all references still resolve.

**Showroom-only requirements:**
- [ ] content/antora.yml exists
- [ ] ui-config.yml exists
- [ ] site.yml exists

### Stage 2: config
Validate infrastructure configuration.

- [ ] instances.yaml: all VMs have name, image, memory, cores
- [ ] instances.yaml: all containers have name, image
- [ ] instances.yaml: routes have valid TLS termination (Edge/Reencrypt)
- [ ] instances.yaml: services have ports defined
- [ ] firewall.yaml: has ingress rules for all service ports
- [ ] firewall.yaml: egress is not wide-open (no 0.0.0.0/0 allow-all)
- [ ] networks.yaml: valid structure
- [ ] ui-config.yml: tabs reference valid routes from instances.yaml

### Stage 3: content
Delegate to showroom:verify-content if available.

If not available, basic checks:
- [ ] All .adoc files in pages/ are valid AsciiDoc
- [ ] nav.adoc references all page files
- [ ] No broken internal xrefs
- [ ] Module numbering is sequential (01, 02, 03...)

### Stage 4: automation
Validate setup and runtime automation.

- [ ] setup-automation/main.yml is valid Ansible
- [ ] setup scripts reference correct hostnames from instances.yaml
- [ ] Setup scripts include wait-for-ready patterns (grep for retry/until/wait)
- [ ] runtime-automation module directories match content modules
- [ ] Each module has at least setup script

### Stage 4b: consistency
Cross-layer consistency check between infrastructure, content, and validation.

This stage catches the most common lab failures: content references resources
that don't exist in the infrastructure, or validation scripts check for hosts
that were removed.

**Host consistency:**
- [ ] Every host mentioned in content pages exists in config/instances.yaml
- [ ] Every host in validation scripts exists in config/instances.yaml
- [ ] Every host in solve scripts exists in config/instances.yaml
- [ ] Content does not reference removed hosts (e.g., rhel-2 after VM was removed)
- [ ] ui-config.yml module count matches content page count

**Resource consistency (when AAP post-install is configured):**
- [ ] Content references to "pre-configured" credentials match what setup scripts create
- [ ] Content references to inventories match what setup scripts create
- [ ] If setup-control.sh is a no-op, content should NOT reference pre-configured AAP resources

**Service consistency:**
- [ ] Every tab URL in ui-config.yml has a corresponding route in instances.yaml
- [ ] Gitea tab exists only if Gitea container is defined
- [ ] Container services that need external access have routes defined

**How to run:**
1. Parse all hostnames from instances.yaml (VM names + container names)
2. Grep content pages for hostname references
3. Grep validation scripts for hostname references
4. Flag any hostname in content/validation that is NOT in instances.yaml
5. Flag any pre-configured resource reference in content that has no setup script creating it

### Stage 5: catalog
Delegate to agnosticv:validator if available.

Only runs if .foundry.yml indicates lab_type is agnosticv or if common.yaml exists.

### Stage 6: ftl
Check for solve/validate scripts in runtime-automation.

- [ ] Each module directory has solve-*.sh or solve.yml
- [ ] Each module directory has validation-*.sh or validate.yml
- [ ] Scripts are executable

### Stage 6b: api-validation (new)
Generate API-driven validation scripts for labs with AAP, Vault, TFE, or other API-accessible services.

This pattern comes from the HashiCorp Summit lab (zt-ans-bu-hashi-aap, lb1390-validation branch)
where solve/validate uses pure `ansible.builtin.uri` calls instead of SSH scripts. This approach
works from the Showroom runner container which has no SSH access to lab VMs and no Ansible
collections installed.

See `foundry/references/zt-hashi-aap.md` for the full pattern.

**When to generate API validation:**
- Lab has AAP controller (most zero-touch labs)
- Lab has Vault, TFE, OPA, NetBox, or other services with REST APIs
- Lab uses workflow job templates or custom credential types

**What gets generated:**

For each module, generate `runtime-automation/module-NN/validation.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: Validate module NN
  hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  gather_facts: false

  vars:
    aap_host: "https://control.{{ lab_domain }}"
    aap_user: "admin"
    aap_pass: "ansible123!"

  tasks:
    # AAP resource checks: verify resources exist via API query
    - name: "Check: credential type exists"
      ansible.builtin.uri:
        url: "{{ aap_host }}/api/controller/v2/credential_types/"
        url_username: "{{ aap_user }}"
        url_password: "{{ aap_pass }}"
        method: GET
        validate_certs: false
        force_basic_auth: true
        body_format: json
        status_code: 200
      register: result

    - name: "Verify: credential type present"
      ansible.builtin.assert:
        that: result.json.count > 0
        fail_msg: "Expected credential type not found"

    # Vault checks (if applicable)
    - name: "Check: Vault secret engine mounted"
      ansible.builtin.uri:
        url: "http://vault.{{ lab_domain }}:8200/v1/sys/mounts"
        headers:
          X-Vault-Token: "{{ vault_token }}"
        status_code: [200, 403]
      register: vault_mounts
```

**Solve script pattern:**

For each module, optionally generate `runtime-automation/module-NN/solve.yml` that
creates all the resources the student should have created, using the same API approach:
```yaml
    # Create resource via API (no collections needed)
    - name: "Create credential in AAP"
      ansible.builtin.uri:
        url: "{{ aap_host }}/api/controller/v2/credentials/"
        url_username: "{{ aap_user }}"
        url_password: "{{ aap_pass }}"
        method: POST
        validate_certs: false
        force_basic_auth: true
        body_format: json
        body:
          name: "My Credential"
          credential_type: 1
          organization: 1
          inputs:
            username: "admin"
            password: "secret"
        status_code: [200, 201]
      register: result
      failed_when: result.status not in [200, 201, 400]
      # 400 = already exists, which is fine (idempotent)
```

**API endpoints to validate per service:**

| Service | Validate Endpoint | What to Check |
|:--------|:------------------|:--------------|
| AAP controller | GET /api/controller/v2/ping/ | Status 200 = healthy |
| AAP credentials | GET /api/controller/v2/credentials/?name=X | count > 0 |
| AAP credential types | GET /api/controller/v2/credential_types/?name=X | count > 0 |
| AAP job templates | GET /api/controller/v2/job_templates/?name=X | count > 0 |
| AAP workflows | GET /api/controller/v2/workflow_job_templates/?name=X | count > 0 |
| AAP inventory sources | GET /api/controller/v2/inventory_sources/?name=X | count > 0 |
| AAP projects | GET /api/controller/v2/projects/?name=X | count > 0, status=successful |
| Vault health | GET /v1/sys/health | initialized=true, sealed=false |
| Vault secret | GET /v1/secret/data/X | data present |
| Vault auth methods | GET /v1/sys/auth | method listed |
| Vault policies | GET /v1/sys/policies/acl/X | policy exists |
| TFE workspaces | GET /api/v2/organizations/ORG/workspaces | workspace found |
| TFE workspace vars | GET /api/v2/workspaces/ID/vars | vars present |
| OPA policy | POST /v1/data/PATH | result.allow = true/false |
| NetBox objects | GET /api/ipam/vlans/?vid=X | count > 0 |

**Generation logic:**

When running `validate-lab` on a lab that has AAP and other API services:
1. Read `.foundry.yml` to identify configured services
2. Read `content/modules/ROOT/pages/` to identify what students create in each module
3. For each module, generate a validation.yml that checks the expected end state
4. For each module, generate a solve.yml that creates the expected end state via API
5. Mark scripts as API-driven in `.foundry.yml` so runtime-automation/main.yml
   knows to run them with `ansible-playbook` instead of `sh`

### Stage 7: health
Generate provisioning health check scripts.

This is the stage Alex W requested. It generates a health check script that:
1. Runs after provisioning completes
2. Checks every service defined in ui-config.yml is accessible
3. Checks every VM/container is running
4. Reports results via webhook (Slack, Mattermost, or custom)
5. Exits non-zero if any critical check fails

**Generated file: utilities/health-check.sh**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Auto-generated by Lab Foundry
# Run after provisioning to verify lab health

WEBHOOK_URL="${HEALTH_WEBHOOK_URL:-}"
LAB_NAME="<lab_name>"
GUID="${GUID:-unknown}"
RESULTS=()
FAILURES=0

check_service() {
    local name="$1" url="$2" expected_code="${3:-200}"
    local code=$(curl -sk -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' --connect-timeout 10 "$url" 2>/dev/null)
    if [ "$code" = "$expected_code" ]; then
        RESULTS+=("PASS: $name ($url) - HTTP $code")
    else
        RESULTS+=("FAIL: $name ($url) - expected $expected_code, got $code")
        ((FAILURES++))
    fi
}

check_port() {
    local name="$1" host="$2" port="$3"
    if timeout 5 bash -c "echo >/dev/tcp/$host/$port" 2>/dev/null; then
        RESULTS+=("PASS: $name ($host:$port) - port open")
    else
        RESULTS+=("FAIL: $name ($host:$port) - port closed")
        ((FAILURES++))
    fi
}

# Generated checks from ui-config.yml and instances.yaml
# (Lab Foundry fills these in based on the lab's config)

report_results() {
    local status="SUCCESS"
    [ "$FAILURES" -gt 0 ] && status="FAILED ($FAILURES failures)"

    local report="Lab Health Report: $LAB_NAME (GUID: $GUID)\nStatus: $status\n"
    for r in "${RESULTS[@]}"; do
        report+="  $r\n"
    done

    echo -e "$report"

    if [ -n "$WEBHOOK_URL" ]; then
        curl -s -X POST "$WEBHOOK_URL" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d "{\"text\": \"$report\", \"lab\": \"$LAB_NAME\", \"guid\": \"$GUID\", \"status\": \"$status\", \"failures\": $FAILURES}" \
            2>/dev/null
    fi
}

# Run all checks
# (Generated per-service checks go here)

report_results
exit $FAILURES
```

**Integration with setup-automation:**
Add a task at the end of setup-automation/main.yml that runs the health check:
```yaml
- name: Run provisioning health check
  ansible.builtin.script: "{{ lookup('env', 'MODULE_DIR') }}/../utilities/health-check.sh"
  environment:
    HEALTH_WEBHOOK_URL: "{{ health_webhook_url | default('') }}"
    GUID: "{{ lookup('env', 'GUID') | default('unknown') }}"
  register: health_result
  failed_when: false

- name: Display health check results
  ansible.builtin.debug:
    msg: "{{ health_result.stdout }}"
```

## Skip Configuration

Create or read `.foundry-skip` in the lab root:
```yaml
skip:
  - catalog    # No AgnosticV catalog yet
  - ftl        # Solve/validate not written yet
  - health     # Not ready for health reporting
```

## Output

Display results as a table:
```
Lab Validation Report: zt-ans-bu-cert-lifecycle
================================================
  structure:  PASS (11/11 checks)
  config:     PASS (8/8 checks)
  content:    PASS (delegated to showroom:verify-content)
  automation: WARN (setup scripts missing retry logic in 2 scripts)
  catalog:    SKIP (configured in .foundry-skip)
  ftl:        SKIP (configured in .foundry-skip)
  health:     GENERATED (utilities/health-check.sh created)
================================================
Overall: PASS with 1 warning
```
